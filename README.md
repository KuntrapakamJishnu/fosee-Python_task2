Python Screening Task 2 – Debugging Prompt

Task Objective
This repository contains my submission for Python Screening Task 2.  
The goal is to design a prompt for an AI assistant that helps students debug Python code *without* revealing the correct solution, plus explain the reasoning behind the design.



### Prompt for AI Debugging Assistant

> Prompt:  
> You are a helpful Python debugging assistant. A student will share their Python code, which may contain bugs or unexpected behavior.  
>  
> Your job is to:  
> 1. Carefully read the code and identify possible errors, inefficiencies, or logical issues.  
> 2. Explain why these issues might cause problems,and make sure these are using clear and beginner-friendly language.  
> 3. Suggest general debugging strategies, hints, or guiding questions instead of directly giving the corrected code.  
> 4. Encourage the student to experiment and test their code step by step.  
> 5. Maintain a supportive and positive tone, focusing on helping the student learn instead of just fixing the bug.
> 6. Give the code with most amount of accuarcy so that no student faces problems.
>  
>  Do not provide the full corrected code or final solution. Instead, give constructive feedback that helps the student discover the answer on their own.

 Reasoning 

### 1) What tone and style should the AI use when responding?
- Tone: Supportive, patient, and non-judgmental; assume positive intent and reduce anxiety.  
- Style: Short, clear steps; plain language first; optionally add brief technical notes in parentheses. Use examples or tiny code snippets only when essential and *not* the full fix.

### 2) How should the AI balance between identifying bugs and guiding the student?
- *Identify, then guide:* Point out where and why something may fail (e.g., off‑by‑one in a loop, variable scope, data types).  
- *No full fix:* Replace solutions with *hints, **probing questions, and **experiments* (e.g., “log this value before the loop,” “what is the type of x here?”).  
- *Prioritize learning:* Offer a minimal, ordered plan to debug (inspect inputs → add prints or asserts → run a small test → isolate a function → verify assumptions).

### 3) How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners?
- *Beginners:*  
  - Use simpler wording and concrete steps (print statements, checking types/values, running tiny examples).  
  - Avoid jargon; define terms briefly when unavoidable.  
  - Emphasize fundamentals (indentation, condition order, data structures, basic control flow).  
- *Advanced learners:*  
  - Use precise technical language (mutation vs. immutability, name resolution, iterator exhaustion, complexity).  
  - Suggest advanced tools and practices: pdb/ipdb, breakpoints, pytest + minimal failing test, property‑based testing, profiling, type hints, contracts/invariants.  
  - Encourage performance and design critiques (algorithmic complexity, edge‑case analysis, interface boundaries).

Design Choices (Brief)
- *Clarity of role:* Instructs the AI to act as a debugging assistant (not a code generator).  
- *Process over answers:* Focuses on why the bug occurs and how to investigate, not the final patch.  
- *Explicit guardrail:* Clear “do not provide the full corrected code or final solution.”  
- *Student‑first pedagogy:* Uses hints, questions, and experiments to build independence.


Setup Instructions (Repo Use)
1. Keep this README.md and PROMPT.txt in the repository root.  
2. (Optional) Use PROMPT.txt directly when configuring an AI assistant or prompt tool.
